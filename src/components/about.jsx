                    <p>I am currently a student in 4th year at Clemson University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematical Sciences. I am set to graduate in December 2021 and as of now I have a 3.62 GPA. My 2-year plan after finishing the undergraduate program at Clemson is to continue my education at graduate school focusing on either software engineering or artificial intelligence.</p>
                    <p>My goals for the upcoming summer are to get an internship where I am focusing on software engineering, as well as working on some of my side projects. During my 3 rotations at Itron, I worked on projects that tested my abilities from hardware to embedded systems to a small portion of software development. I am wanting my next internship to challenge me in a more software development and engineering role to further broaden my breadth of knowledge as well as see if software engineering is really my desired path.</p>
                    <p>When I am not programming or doing schoolwork, I am usually found doing something active. I regularly play and referee soccer,  as well as powerlift. At Clemson, I participate in both intramural soccer and the Clemson Weight Club. On the weekends, I am usually at the soccer field refereeing youth and adult games, which I have been doing for over the past 7 years.</p>
